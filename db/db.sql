This time, however, the time bonus (bottom right of the screen) decreases faster. If it reaches zero then Quazi bites the dust!</p>\r\n<p>Though this version of Hunchback may not offer all the varied levels of the arcade original, it still offers a satisfactory challenge for even the most skilled players.</p>\r\n<p>This program is also an excellent demonstration of just how BBC BASIC can be.

The aim is to shoot as many targets as possible, without running into them, the walls or the obstacles. Herman can be controlled by either the keyboard or two joysticks, and the method of control is a little different to most games. If you are using joysticks the left stick controls his left caterpillar track and the fight stick controls his fight caterpillar track, so if both sticks are fully forward he will go forward at top speed, and if they are both back he will go in reverse at top speed. If one stick is forward and one back he will turn. Using the keyboard is similar:</p>\r\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A - Left track forward<br />Z - Left track backwards<br />* - Right track forward<br />? - Right track backwards<br />SPACE - Fire</p>\r\n</blockquote>', 1, 1, 'O', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, '2019-01-04 16:24:15', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, '2018-12-27 10:41:25', 2, 'N', 'Y', '0'),

The crypt, needless to say, is guarded by a monster which will destroy the world if the diamond is not replaced. The ambition of monster''s know no bounds. You have a limited time before you will be killed by the monster, which was designed by Gabon, who is buried in the crypt.</p>\r\n<p>You have to direct the computer to manipulate the objects you come across, and to move around. As with all good ADVENTURE programs, much of the pleasure in playing comes from discovering the vocabulary the computer will understand, so we will not give too much away in the introduction. The computer has, however, an extensive vocabulary, so if one command doesn''t work, try another.</p>\r\n<p>The program has been written so that only the first three letters of each command and object need to be typed in, although the computer will also accept the full word. For example, if you wished to say GET DIAMOND, the BBC Micro will accept GET DIA or GET DIAMOND.

P. Lovecraft, who wrote eerie horror stories about mysterious long-dead civilisations and all-powerful evil gods out to destroy you at the mere mention of their name. Though not in the sword-and-sorcery vein, this scenario is just as exciting &mdash; anything might happen . . .</p>\r\n<p>Your aim is to get all the money you can, then find safety. The commands can be entered in upper or lower case. Instructions are included in the program.</p>\r\n<p>There is a feature for disc users &mdash; you can create macros. Macros are used when you wish to save a &lsquo;routine&rsquo;, such as the commands to go into a creature&rsquo;s lair and kill it.

In addition, a number of instrument readings give essential details of such things as altitude, speed, direction, pitch, roll, and distance from the runway. Keys may be used to manoeuvre the aeroplane in terms of its speed, roll and pitch, the pilot''s efforts being reflected in the instrument readings. Realistic sound effects accompany the simulation, which will soon discover whether you can say with honesty "I''ll take good care of you!"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The identical description was also contained in the book accompanying the <em>PCW Games Collection</em>, which also added the following:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h3>Flying tips</h3>\r\n<p>The distance reading indicates the distance you are from the end of the runway.

If the tank crashes into any obstacles, the game will end; otherwise, you have five runs in which to destroy all the targets.

Well may you ask that question, but to find out you&rsquo;ll have to play this game. Here are just a few clues. The game is played on an eight-by-eight checkered board and the object of the game is to trap the quark and prevent him from reaching the bottom of the board. To do this you have two, three or four (determined at random) pieces, or &lsquo;quatlins&rsquo;, which can be moved diagonally one square at a time and only up the board. The quark also moves diagonally but he can move both forwards and backwards.</p>\r\n<h3>How to play</h3>\r\n<p>At the beginning of the game your quatlins (two, three or four of them according to the luck of the draw) are ranged along the bottom line and the quark is at the top of the board. It is your move first. You&rsquo;ll notice that one of your quatlins is displayed in different colours from the rest. This is the piece that is ready to move. If you want to move another piece hit any key and control will pass to the next piece in an anti-clockwise direction. Try pressing keys to see this in operation. When you are ready to move a piece press the left arrow key if you want to move diagonally forward left and the right arrow key if you want to move diagonally forward right. Once you have moved, the quark will make his move automatically and its your turn again. The BBC Micro will display a message when the game is won, either by you or the quark, but if you want to resign before this, type &ldquo;R&rdquo;. Just in case you hit this key by mistake you will be given the chance to reconsider and will have to answer &ldquo;Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;N&rdquo; to the question &ldquo;Resign?&rdquo;.</p>\r\n</blockquote>', 1, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 3, '2019-04-19 13:55:30', '2018-12-30 10:32:26', 2, '2019-09-06 11:12:02', 2, 'N', 'Y', '0'),

The object is to make words, for which the computer awards points, the first player reaching a score of 200 points being the winner.</p>\r\n<p>On his or her turn, the player may do one of three things: (a) shuffle the letter pool, (b) take a letter from the pool and add it to his hand, or (c) make a word from the letters in his hand. To shuffle the pool, the player simply presses RETURN. To take up a letter from the pool, the letter is typed. The computer removes the letter from the pool and adds it to those in the player''s hand, then selects another letter for the pool. To play a word, the player types the whole word and presses RETURN. The computer checks that the word is possible from the letters in the hand, and if so, asks if any other player objects to the word or to its spelling. If all is well, the score is calculated and the letters are removed from the player''s hand.</p>\r\n<p>Please note very carefully that the score for a word depends upon (a) the individual values of the letters making up the word, (b) the length of the word, with longer words scoring heavily, and (c) the number of letters remaining in the hand; the more letters left unused, the greater the penalty. At the extreme, it is just possible to play a short word, have a lot of letters left over and so be awarded a negative score!</p>\r\n<p>There are ''jokers'' in the form of ''*'', which have no value but which may be used in place of any letter. To pick up such a joker, the ''*'' must be typed. On the other hand, to play a word containing a joker, the player does not include ''*'', but types the whole word as he or she wishes it to be. The computer first checks for normal letters and if one or more short, checks for jokers.</p>\r\n<p>Before and after each player''s move there is a timed delay for thought and observation, but players may move the game on swiftly by pressing RETURN.

The elements of this game are simple &minus; a blue sky with a single white cloud, a bird winging its way from left to right and your rifle sight. The object is straightforward &minus; to line up the sight with the bird and shoot it &minus; but in practice its not that simple. Every time you fire, your rifle &lsquo;kicks&rsquo; to one side or the other so you have to re-align your sight for your next shot and the bird (and your sight too) disappears behind the cloud when they reach it. A total of five birds fly across the sky and there is no limit to the number of hits you can score &minus; your total for each bird and the whole game are displayed at the end. There is a convincing sound every time you fire your rifle and a distinctive bell-like sound when you hit the bird.</p>\r\n<h3>How to play</h3>\r\n<p>To hit the target you have to line the cross point of your sight up with the centre of the bird. Use all four arrow keys to move your sight and press &lsquo;F&rsquo; to fire. There are five birds in all and you may hit each one as often as you can.</p>\r\n</blockquote>', 1, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 3, '2019-04-19 13:55:02', '2019-01-02 15:32:07', 2, '2019-01-03 14:49:52', 2, 'N', 'Y', '0'),

The object of the game is to get</strong><br /><strong>your party of five intrepid explorers across a deep ravine with a fast</strong><br /><strong>flowing river at the bottom of steep cliffs. There is only one option, to</strong><br /><strong>swing across on a rope. The rope swings all the time so each man must</strong><br /><strong>run and leap to catch it &minus; any one who mistimes his jump falls into the</strong><br /><strong>river and is lost. Listen out for the sound effects as a man falls towards</strong><br /><strong>the river!</strong><br /><strong>How to play:</strong><br /><strong>This game is all a matter of timing &minus; you have to judge when to start</strong><br /><strong>each run for the rope. It is vital to catch the rope on the downswing</strong><br /><strong>and each man can jump approximately his own width. You can wait as</strong><br /><strong>long as you like before making any run and when you are ready press</strong><br /><strong>any key to jump. When your first little man has made his run and</strong><br /><strong>either swung to safety, or perished, the second explorer will appear in</strong><br /><strong>position. There are five of them in all and the length of the rope</strong><br /><strong>remains the same for all of them.

Your city is the target for a number of</strong><br /><strong>nuclear bombs, and your job is to protect as many people as</strong><br /><strong>you can from the nuclear blast. If you have strong objections to</strong><br /><strong>the basic idea behind this game, you could still use the new</strong><br /><strong>framework to produce a game of your choice, protecting a toy</strong><br /><strong>factory from an invasion of wicked gnome-missiles or whatever</strong><br /><strong>you like.</strong><br /><strong>The game fits into the general ''Kingdoms'' category, that</strong><br /><strong>class of computer games which attempts to model reality in</strong><br /><strong>some way. These programs expect you to make decisions about</strong><br /><strong>the expenditure of limited resources in order to acquire items</strong><br /><strong>which are needed for the continued existence of your city,</strong><br /><strong>country of planet.</strong><br /><strong>In this case, your resource is money, and you need to buy</strong><br /><strong>as much shelter as you can, in order to save the maximum</strong><br /><strong>number of people. This analysis of the game suggests that any</strong><br /><strong>scenario requiring you to buy a single resource to achieve a</strong><br /><strong>specific aim could be slotted into the framework of this</strong><br /><strong>program. Essentially, all you would need to change would be</strong><br /><strong>the print statements.</strong><br /><strong>The idea, then, is to protect as many people as you can</strong><br /><strong>from a nuclear blast. You start off with an amount of money</strong><br /><strong>which steadily increases as the game progresses. You must</strong><br /><strong>decide whether to buy shelter and use up most of your money,</strong><br /><strong>or to save it in order to buy the largest possible area of shelter</strong><br /><strong>later on. The only problem with this latter idea is that a nuclear</strong><br /><strong>attack could be launched when you have no shelter at all. And</strong><br /><strong>if you have no shelter, there will be no survivors.</strong><br /><strong>In most Kingdom-type games, the ruler is assassinated,</strong><br /><strong>impeached, lynched or otherwise disposed of, if a certain</strong><br /><strong>proportion of the people in his or her care die, whether the</strong><br /><strong>deaths occur from famine, plagues of rats, attacks by muscle-</strong><br /><strong>bound Norsemen in long boats, or - as in this case - from a</strong><br /><strong>nuclear blast. If more than half your city is wiped out, the</strong><br /><strong>hitherto complacent masses (or, at least, those who have</strong><br /><strong>survived) will rise up in one coordinated movement and wipe</strong><br /><strong>you and your family out.</strong><br /><strong>You must balance your delay in spending money for shelter</strong><br /><strong>against the fact that, in this game, the longer you delay, the</strong><br /><strong>more likely a nuclear attack becomes. This chance increases</strong><br /><strong>and, at the end of the game, it is close to one in one.</strong><br /><strong>Full instructions are included within the game.</strong></p>', 1, 1, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 2, '2019-08-31 17:01:47', '2019-08-19 11:16:03', 2, '2019-08-19 12:12:04', 2, 'N', 'Y', '0'),
